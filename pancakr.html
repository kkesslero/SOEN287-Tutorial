<!-- create an unordered list -->

<ul>

<!--the list contains four list items -->

<li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>

<li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>

<li> 2 3/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>

<li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>

<li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>

<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for serving</li>

<li> Vegetable oil, for the griddle</li>

<li>Pure maple syrup, warmed, for serving</li>

</ul>

<ol>

<p><h3>Steps</h3></p>

<li>

Place a heat-proof platter into a warm oven (at 200 degrees).</li>

<li>

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add in the egg, milk, and 2 tablespoons of the butter. Whisk from the center, slowly incorporating the flour.

Rest the batter for 10 minutes.</li>

<li>

Heat a large well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or favorite griddle over medium-high heat. Swirl the remaining tablespoon of butter in the skillet (or use oil to coat the griddle) and immediately pour in 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. When bubbles rise to the surface, flip the pancakes, slightly reduce the heat, and cook until the bottoms are golden and the centers are cooked, about 1 minute. (Rarely does the first pancake work because it takes a bit of time to get in the groove with the heat, fat, and batter.)</li>

<li>

As the pancakes come out of the skillet, place them on the warm platter in the oven until ready to serve. Serve a stack of 3 pancakes, topped with more butter and the maple syrup.</li>

</ol>
